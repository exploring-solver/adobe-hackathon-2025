You want me to take the detailed project READMEs you've provided and condense them into a single, smaller README file for the root of your project. This new README should be around 100-150 words and should summarize what you built for both challenges, link to the challenge folders, and credit the team members.

I will use the content you provided to create this concise summary, focusing on the core purpose of each challenge's solution.

Here is the condensed README:

# Adobe Hackathon 2025: PDF Intelligence Suite

This project contains our solution for the Adobe India Hackathon 2025, a comprehensive suite of tools designed to transform how we interact with PDFs.

  * **Challenge 1A: PDF Heading Extractor**
    We built a fast, accurate, and multilingual system to extract the structural outlines of PDF documents. Our hybrid approach uses both fast heuristic analysis and a lightweight AI model to identify and classify headings (Title, H1, H2, H3), delivering reliable results in seconds.

  * **Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence**
    We developed an intelligent system that analyzes a collection of PDFs to find the most relevant information for a user's specific job. The solution uses a sentence transformer model to prioritize sections based on a given persona and task, generating a structured output for easy consumption.

You can find the full documentation and code in the respective challenge folders below.
